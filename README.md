The first circuit is a jhonson counter- The Johnson counter is similar to the Ring counter. The only difference between the Johnson counter and the ring counter is that the outcome of the last flip flop is passed to the first flip flop as an input. But in Johnson counter, the inverted outcome Q' of the last flip flop is passed as an input. The remaining work of the Johnson counter is the same as a ring counter. The Johnson counter is also referred to as the Creeping counter\

The second circuit is a 2 bit multiplier circuit - A Binary Multiplier is a digital circuit used in digital electronics to multiply two binary numbers and provide the result as output. The method used to multiply two binary numbers.  Long multiplicand is multiplied by 0 or 1 which is much easier than decimal multiplication as product by 0 or 1 is 0 or same number respectively.\
